    Load & prepare functional data.

    Parameters
    ----------
    strPathNiiMask: str
        Path or mask used to restrict pRF model finding. Only voxels with
        a value greater than zero in the mask are considered.
    lstPathNiiFunc : list
        List of paths of functional data (nii files).
    varAvgThr : float, positive, default = 100.
        Float. Voxels that have at least one run with a mean lower than this
        (before demeaning) will be excluded from model fitting.
    varVarThr : float, positive, default = 0.0001
        Float. Voxels that have at least one run with a variance lower than
        this (after demeaning) will be excluded from model fitting.

    Returns
    -------
    aryLgcMsk : np.array
        3D numpy array with logial values. Externally supplied mask (e.g grey
        matter mask). Voxels that are `False` in the mask are excluded.
    vecLgcIncl : np.array
        1D numpy array containing logical values. One value per voxel after
        mask has been applied. If `True`, the variance and mean of the voxel's
        time course are greater than the provided thresholds in all runs and
        the voxel is included in the output array (`aryFunc`). If `False`, the
        variance or mean of the voxel's time course is lower than threshold in
        at least one run and the voxel has been excluded from the output
        (`aryFunc`). This is to avoid problems in the subsequent model fitting.
        This array is necessary to put results into original dimensions after
        model fitting.
    hdrMsk : nibabel-header-object
        Nii header of mask.
    aryAff : np.array
        Array containing 'affine', i.e. information about spatial positioning
        of mask nii data.
    aryFunc : np.array
        2D numpy array containing prepared functional data, of the form
        aryFunc[voxelCount, time].
    tplNiiShp : tuple
        Spatial dimensions of input nii data (number of voxels in x, y, z
        direction). The data are reshaped during preparation, this
        information is needed to fit final output into original spatial
        dimensions.

    Notes
    -----
    Functional data is loaded from disk. The functional data is reshaped, into
    the form aryFunc[voxel, time]. A mask is applied (externally supplied, e.g.
    a grey matter mask). Subsequently, the functional data is de-meaned.
